# Conditional Rendering with v-if
Using `v-if` directive we can toggle the presence of an element.

Currently you can see some text on the page, but if enter `app3.isSeen = false` in the console. You should see the message disappear.

Also, if you try entering `app3.isSeen = !app3.isSeen` multiple times, you will the toggle display behavior with text showing, hiding, showing and so on.
