# Loops in Vue with v-for
The `v-for` directive is used for displaying a list of items using the data from an Array.

In the console, enter `app5.cars.push({name: 'Ford'})`. You should see a new car name appended to the list.

Also, if you enter `app5.cars.pop()`, you would see the last car name removed from the list.
